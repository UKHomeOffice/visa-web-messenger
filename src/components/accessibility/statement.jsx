      <ul className='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced'>
        <li>
          change colours, contrast levels and fonts
        </li>
        <li>
          zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
        </li>
        <li>
          navigate most of the service using just a keyboard
        </li>
        <li>
          navigate most of the service using speech recognition software
        </li>
        <li>
          listen to most of the service using a screen reader
          (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
        </li>
        <li>
          move focus from the launcher to the messenger window
