        This service is run by the Home Office. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service.
        For example, that means you should be able to:
      </p>
      <ul className='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced'>
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>
          zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
        </li>
        <li>
          navigate most of the service using just a keyboard
        </li>
        <li>
          navigate most of the service using speech recognition software
        </li>
        <li>
          listen to most of the service using a screen reader
          (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="govuk-body">
        We've also made the service text as simple as possible to understand. <a href='https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/'>
